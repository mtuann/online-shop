# Description

Online shop prototype implemented using React, Redux, React Router, and React Material UI library. I created
this project mainly as a learning experience for myself.

**Some features**:
- Search products using keyword and/or category
- Ability to filter and sort products by price
- Users can add products to shopping cart 
 
# How to use

1. Clone the repository.

    _NOTE_: Currently the project has grown in size a bit (roughly 45MB) mainly due to .git folder size (this is probably because I had to upload different versions of a certain .gif file throughout time). To download the project with reduced .git folder size use: ```git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mtuann/online-shop.git```.  

2. ```cd``` into the project folder.
3. ```npm install```
4. ```npm audit fix --force```
5. ```npm start```

- if you have problem with "npm-error-code-elifecycle", try to clear current cache: npm chace clean -- force and then npm install and nom start the project
